# BitsAndPieces

This project contains 4 sub programs.

1. Factorial: Iterative (non-recursive) function to compute F(n) Recursive function to compute F(n)
The printed output looks as follows
```
Non Recursive = 120
Recursive = 120
```

2. NGram: This program searches text within a file and finds the frequencies of sequences of words within that text

The printed output looks as follows
```  
************* For n=3 *************
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{, if the}
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{who think the}
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{make a few}
FREQUENCY : 4,       0.002	{would like to}

************* For n=2 *************
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{not included}
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{Europe .}
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{comment on}
FREQUENCY : 8,       0.004	{on the}

************* For n=1 *************
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{need}
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{said}
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{French}FREQUENCY : 108,     0.051	{the}
FREQUENCY : 6,       0.003	{I would like}
```
3. MostFrequentBeforeAndAfter: search for a word "the" and find the the word that appears most frequently before and after

The printed output looks as follows
```
Most Frequent before : of
Most Frequent after : vote
```

4. StringIntegerSpeed

The printed output looks as follows
```
String.valueOf took an average of 0.132 us and ""+ took an average of 0.196 us
String.valueOf took an average of 0.086 us and ""+ took an average of 0.146 us
String.valueOf took an average of 0.086 us and ""+ took an average of 0.143 us
```
