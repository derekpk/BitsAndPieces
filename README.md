# BitsAndPieces

This project contains 4 pieces of code.

1. Factorial:
    * Iterative (non-recursive) function to compute F(n) 
	  * Recursive function to compute F(n)

2. NGram:
    * This program searches text within a file and finds the frequencies of sequences of words within that text

The printed output looks as follows
  
************* For n=3 *************
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{, if the}
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{who think the}
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{make a few}
FREQUENCY : 4,       0.002	{would like to}

    ************* For n=2 *************
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{not included}
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{Europe .}
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{comment on}
FREQUENCY : 8,       0.004	{on the}

************* For n=1 *************
FREQUENCY : 1,       0.000	{need}
